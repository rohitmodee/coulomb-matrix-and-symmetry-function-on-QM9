# coulomb-matrix-and-symmetry-function-on-QM9

This is a small tutorial where I have computed the coulomb matrix and atom-centered symmetry function (ACSF) descriptor on QM9.

```data``` folder contains 3 ```.npz``` files i.e. ```train.npz```, ```valid.npz``` and ```test.npz```. This data was created using https://github.com/vgsatorras/egnn.

The results shown below are based on the following.
Training set = 17748.
Validated set = 13083.
